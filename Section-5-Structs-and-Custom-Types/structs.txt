-- What are structs?
Struct are a data structure that let you group data & functions into collections.

-- If you have a method that wants to edit a struct, 
you must make sure that it receives a pointer to that struct as a receiver argument.
Otherwise, it will get a copy and just edit that copy. 

-- same goes for contruction function,
